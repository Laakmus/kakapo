-- KAKAPO Database Schema - Row Level Security Policies
-- Migration: 20240101000003_rls_policies

-- =============================================================================
-- NOTE: NO RLS FOR auth.users
-- =============================================================================
-- We use Supabase Auth's auth.users table which has its own built-in security.
-- User data access is controlled through auth.uid() in other table policies.
-- To access user metadata (first_name, last_name):
--   - auth.uid() returns current user's ID
--   - auth.email() returns current user's email
--   - auth.jwt() -> 'user_metadata' ->> 'first_name' returns first_name from metadata
